#### About me
I am a recent graduate in Spanish and Linguistics from the University of Oxford. I love languages, reading, football, CS:GO (a bit too much), playing chess, and Oxford commas.

#### I'm currently working on
- The [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp, starting in March.
- Learning Japanese (at a snail's pace...)
- Reading as much as time allows (follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109060712-gregor-aubrey)!)
- Learning more about Linux and FOSS

#### How to reach me
Just shoot me an email at gregor.aubrey.uk@gmail.com and I'll get back to you.
