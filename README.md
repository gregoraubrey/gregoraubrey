#### About me
I am a recent graduate in Spanish and Linguistics from the University of Oxford and have just completed an intense 16-week bootcamp with [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/). I went from zero (learning about strings and Booleans in week 1), to creating a full-stack web application called [SwAPP](http://swappbitbybit.netlify.app/) using React (with TypeScript and Material UI) and Supabase by the end.

#### I'm currently working on
- [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109060712-gregor-aubrey) as much as time allows.
- Learning more about Linux and FOSS.

#### How to reach me
- Feel free to email me at gregoraubrey@protonmail.com.
